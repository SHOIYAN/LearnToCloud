# Music Albums API

This project is a serverless REST API for retrieving information about music albums. The API is hosted on AWS and leverages services such as DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, and API Gateway. It provides two endpoints to list all music albums and retrieve albums by release year.

## Project Overview

The Music Albums API allows clients to:
1. Retrieve a list of all albums with metadata, including cover images.
2. Filter albums based on release year.

## Infrastructure

The application stack includes the following components:
- **DynamoDB**: Stores album information (title, artist, genre, release year, and cover image URL).
- **S3**: Stores cover images for each album.
- **Lambda**: Serverless functions that handle API requests.
- **API Gateway**: Exposes API endpoints to interact with Lambda functions.

## Data Model

Each album entry in the DynamoDB database follows this structure:
```json
{
    "album_id": "unique-album-id",
    "title": "Album Title",
    "artist": "Artist Name",
    "genre": "Genre",
    "release_year": "Year of Release",
    "cover_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/album-cover.jpg"
}
```
